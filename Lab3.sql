Consider the schema for MovieDatabase:  
ACTOR (Act_id, Act_Name, Act_Gender) 
DIRECTOR (Dir_id, Dir_Name, Dir_Phone) MOVIES (Mov_id, Mov_Title, Mov_Year, Mov_Lang, Dir_id)

Write SQL queries to 
a. List the titles of all movies directed by „Hitchcock‟.
b. Find the movie names where one or more actors acted in two or more movies. 
c. List  all  actors  who  acted  in  a  movie  before  2000  and  also  in  a  movie  after  2015 (use JOIN operation).
d. Find  the  title  of movies and  number  of  stars  for  each  movie  that  has  at  least  one  rating and find the highest number of stars that movie received. Sort the result by movie title. 
e. Update rating of all movies directed by „Steven Spielberg‟ to 5.
